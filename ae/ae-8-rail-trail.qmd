## Packages and data

```{r}
#| label: load-pkgs-data
#| message: false
 
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

rail_trail <- read_csv("data/rail_trail.csv")
```

## Exercise 1

Fit a model predicting `volume` from `hightemp` and `season`.

```{r}
rt_mlr_main_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(volume ~ hightemp + season, data = rail_trail)

tidy(rt_mlr_main_fit)
```

Recreate the following visualization which displays the three regression lines we can draw based on the results of this model.

![](images/main-effects-lines.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

```{r}
#| label: main-effects-lines

# add code here
```

## Exercise 2

Add an interaction effect between `hightemp` and `season` and comment on the significance of the interaction predictors.
Time permitting, visualize the interaction model as well.

```{r}
#| label: interaction-effects

# add code here
```

## Exercise 3

Fit a model predicting `volume` from all available predictors.

```{r}
rt_full_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(volume ~ ., data = rail_trail)

tidy(rt_full_fit)
```

Recreate the following visualization which displays a histogram of residuals and a normal density curve overlaid.

![](images/density-hist.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

```{r}
#| label: density-histogram

# add code here
```
