## Part 2 of the exam

-   **Goal:** Assess your understanding of the course material and how the methods you learned are applied to the analysis of real-world data.

## Assessment criteria {.smaller}

-   You can identify the correct approach, analysis method, and/or inferential results required to answer the question.

-   You can write results and conclusions in a meaningful way that can be understood by a general audience (think a business or research partner)
-   You can produce a report that is suitable for a professional audience (e.g., narrative is written in complete sentences, all graphs have proper titles and axis labels, there is not extraneous output, all Latex is rendered)
-   You can conduct the analysis using a reproducible data analysis workflow that incorporates version control
