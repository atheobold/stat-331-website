-   Rename the dataset as `movie_scores`

```{r data-prep}
#| echo: true
movie_scores <- fandango %>%
  rename(
    critics = rottentomatoes, 
    audience = rottentomatoes_user
  )
```

## Data overview

## Regression model {#regression-model-1}

A **regression model** is a function that describes the relationship between the outcome, $Y$, and the predictor, $X$.

$$\begin{aligned} Y &= \color{black}{\textbf{Model}} + \text{Error} \\[8pt]
&= \color{black}{\mathbf{f(X)}} + \epsilon \\[8pt]
&= \color{black}{\boldsymbol{\mu_{Y|X}}} + \epsilon \end{aligned}$$

# Simple linear regression

## Simple linear regression

Use **simple linear regression** to model the relationthip between a quantitative outcome ($Y$) and a single quantitative predictor ($X$): $$\Large{Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon}$$

::: incremental
-   $\beta_1$: True slope of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$
-   $\beta_0$: True intercept of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$
-   $\epsilon$: Error (residual)
:::

## Simple linear regression

$$\Large{\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X}$$

-   $\hat{\beta}_1$: Estimated slope of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$
-   $\hat{\beta}_0$: Estimated intercept of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$
-   No error term!

## Choosing values for $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_0$

```{r}
ggplot(data = movie_scores, 
       mapping = aes(x = critics, y = audience)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 32.3155, slope = 0.5187, color = "purple", size = 1) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 25, slope = 0.7, color = "gray") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 21, slope = 0.9, color = "gray") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 35, slope = 0.3, color = "gray") +
  labs(x = "Critics Score", y = "Audience Score")
```

## Residuals

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(data = movie_scores, mapping = aes(x = critics, y = audience)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "purple", se = FALSE) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = critics, xend = critics, y = audience, yend = predict(m)), color = "steel blue") +
  labs(x = "Critics Score", y = "Audience Score") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

$$\text{residual} = \text{observed} - \text{predicted} = y - \hat{y}$$

## Least squares line

-   The residual for the $i^{th}$ observation is

$$e_i = \text{observed} - \text{predicted} = y_i - \hat{y}_i$$

-   The **sum of squared** residuals is

$$e^2_1 + e^2_2 + \dots + e^2_n$$

-   The **least squares line** is the one that minimizes the sum of squared residuals

```{r}
sx <- round(sqrt(var(movie_scores$critics)), 4)
sy <- round(sqrt(var(movie_scores$audience)), 4)
r <- round(cor(movie_scores$critics, movie_scores$audience), 4)
xbar <- round(mean(movie_scores$critics), 4)
ybar <- round(mean(movie_scores$audience), 4)
```

# Slope and intercept

## Properties of least squares regression

-   The regression line goes through the center of mass point, the coordinates corresponding to average $X$ and average $Y$: $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{X}$

-   The slope has the same sign as the correlation coefficient: $\hat{\beta}_1 = r \frac{s_Y}{s_X}$

-   The sum of the residuals is zero: $\sum_{i = 1}^n \epsilon_i = 0$

-   The residuals and $X$ values are uncorrelated

## Estimating the slope

$$\large{\hat{\beta}_1 = r \frac{s_Y}{s_X}}$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
$$
\begin{aligned} 
s_X &= 30.1688 \\
s_Y &=  20.0244 \\
r &= 0.7814
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\beta}_1 &= 0.7814 \times \frac{20.0244}{30.1688} \\
&= 0.5187\end{aligned}
$$
:::
:::

## Estimating the intercept

$$\large{\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{X}}$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
$$\begin{aligned}
&\bar{x} = 60.8493 \\
&\bar{y} = 63.8767 \\
&\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.5187
\end{aligned}$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
$$
\begin{aligned}\hat{\beta}_0 &= 63.8767 - 0.5187 \times 60.8493 \\
&= 32.3142
\end{aligned}
$$

## Interpreting the slope {.smaller}

**Poll:** The slope of the model for predicting audience score from critics score is 32.3142.
Which of the following is the best interpretation of this value?

-   For every one point increase in the critics score, the audience score goes up by 0.5187 points, on average.
-   For every one point increase in the critics score, we expect the audience score to be higher by 0.5187 points, on average.
-   For every one point increase in the critics score, the audience score goes up by 0.5187 points.
-   For every one point increase in the audience score, the critics score goes up by 0.5187 points, on average.

## Interpreting slope & intercept

$$\widehat{\text{audience}} = 32.3142 + 0.5187 \times \text{critics}$$

::: incremental
-   **Slope:** For every one point increase in the critics score, we expect the audience score to be higher by 0.5187 points, on average.
-   **Intercept:** If the critics score is 0 points, we expect the audience score to be 32.3142 points.
:::

## Is the intercept meaningful?

âœ… The intercept is meaningful in context of the data if

-   the predictor can feasibly take values equal to or near zero or
-   the predictor has values near zero in the observed data

. . .

ðŸ›‘ Otherwise, it might not be meaningful!

# Prediction

## Making a prediction

Suppose that a movie has a critics score of 50.
According to this model, what is the movie's predicted audience score?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\text{audience}} &= 32.3142 + 0.5187 \times \text{critics} \\
&= 32.3142 + 0.5187 \times 50 \\
&= 58.2492
\end{aligned}
$$

## Extrapolation

Suppose that a movie has a critics score of 0.
According to this model, what is the movie's predicted audience score?

```{r}
p + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100))
```

# Recap

## Recap {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Used simple linear regression to describe the relationship between a quantitative predictor and quantitative outcome variable.

-   Used the least squares method to estimate the slope and intercept.Ã¥

-   We interpreted the slope and intercept.

    ::: incremental
    -   **Slope:** For every one unit increase in $x$, we expect y to be higher/lower by $\hat{\beta}_1$ units, on average.
    -   **Intercept:** If $x$ is 0, then we expect $y$ to be $\hat{\beta}_0$ units.
    :::

-   Predicted the response given a value of the predictor variable.

-   Defined extrapolation and why we should avoid it.
