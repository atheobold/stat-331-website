# Instructions

## Overview

Exam 3 is released on Friday, April 15 at 9 am ET and must be completed by Mon, April 18 at 11:59 pm.

The exam will consist of two parts:

1.  **Part 1 - Conceptual:** Multiple choice questions on Sakai test and quizzes.
    -   Go [here](https://sakai.duke.edu/samigo-app/servlet/Login?id=6fa7ebf3-01af-42a6-91ba-3e813d3901221650033946378) to complete Part 1 of the exam.
    -   This portion is comprised of 10 multiple choice / fill in the blank questions may only be submitted one time, so start it when you can set aside \~30 minutes to work on it. You will likely be done quicker but it's best to set aside ample time.
2.  **Part 2 - Applied:** Data analysis in RStudio and submitted in Gradescope, like a usual lab and homework.
    -   Go to the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/sta210-s22/) for the course and find the **exam-3-** repo to complete Part 2 of your exam.
    -   Add your answers to the `exam-3.qmd` file in your repo.
    -   You can work on this portion at your own pace and come back to it however many times you like until the deadline. I recommend setting aside \~2 hours. You will likely be done quicker, but it's best to set aside ample time.

**Both portions must be completed and submitted by Mon, April 18 at 11:59 pm**.
Late work will only be accepted in the case of of extenuating circumstances and notification from your academic dean.
